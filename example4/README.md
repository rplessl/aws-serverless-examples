# Serverless API Sample Project

Have a look to this [Website]{https://www.jeremydaly.com/build-serverless-api-serverless-aws-lambda-lambda-api/}.

# More original README.md

This is a sample [Serverless](https://serverless.com) project that creates a serverless API using the [Serverless](https://serverless.com) framework and [Lambda API](https://github.com/jeremydaly/lambda-api), a lightweight web framework for your serverless applications.

This project is a companion to the post [How To: Build a Serverless API with Serverless, AWS Lambda and lambda-api](https://www.jeremydaly.com/build-serverless-api-serverless-aws-lambda-lambda-api) at [JeremyDaly.com](https://www.jeremydaly.com).

This project is free to use as a starting point for building your Serverless APIs.

## Requirements
This project requires the installation of the [Serverless](https://serverless.com) framework:

```bash
npm install -g serverless
```
More details at: https://serverless.com/learn/quick-start/

This project is also dependent on [Lambda API](https://github.com/jeremydaly/lambda-api) and [serverless-stage-manager](https://github.com/jeremydaly/serverless-stage-manager). Both can be installed by running the following in the cloned project folder:

```bash
npm install
```
